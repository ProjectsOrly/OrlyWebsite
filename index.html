        <h1>Q&A</h1>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">How do I transfer files?</h2>
          <p>
            Once you have downloaded the desktop application, you will be able to transfer files from your mobile device
            to your computer by simply clicking the "Start Upload" button on the mobile app. Just remember to adjust the settings to your liking first :)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">I'm having trouble connecting my devices. What can I do?</h2>
          <p>
            If you're having trouble creating a connection between your devices, ensure that they are both connected to
            the same Wi-Fi network. If that doesn't work, it's possible that your firewall is blocking the connection.
            In that case, try adjusting your firewall settings to allow the connection.
            <br/> Also if you're attempting to connecting with IOS device, make sure that local network permission is enabled in the settings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">Will the app delete any files from my mobile device?</h2>
          <p>
            No, the app does not have the ability to delete any files from your mobile device, nor do we wish to take
            any responsibility for such actions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">I'm receiving a "Folder does not exist" error</h2>
          <p>
            There are a few possibilities for this error message. It could be that the folder truly does not exist, or
            perhaps the folder was renamed. Additionally, it's possible that the folder is located in a location that
            the desktop app cannot access, such as OneDrive or a similar service.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox"> 
          <h2 class="accordion">I cant view HEIC format files</h2>
          <p>
            Windows users who are unable to view HEIC format files on their computers may need to install a plugin. This extension enables Windows to support HEIC format files. You can download it from the following <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/hevc-video-extensions-from-device-manufacturer/9N4WGH0Z6VHQ">Link</a><br/>( Orly does not own or take any responsibility for this extension )
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">Is the app secure?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, Your files are transferred directly from your computer to your phone via a local WiFi connection. This
            means that your files remain solely within your personal devices and are not stored on any external servers
            or clouds, Orly does not take any responsibility for any files that are transferred.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="questionBox">
          <h2 class="accordion">I accidentally deleted my connection</h2>
          <p>
            If you have accidentally deleted the connection from your mobile or computer, you can simply create a new
            connection and adjust the sync date in your mobile settings to match the previous connection. This will
            allow you to resume where you left off with ease.
